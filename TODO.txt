### TODO

0. INTERLUDE LEVEL CLEARED has 2 audio channels overlapping
1. Player/pilot roster (top 10 players and show current point score in right top corner)
2. Save roster to disk and show when game is over
3. Fix level announcement not working because of checking for pause condition
4. Show illegal input entry
5. If player name not set we should blit that the key is reserved if any of the special keys are called
6. Add more levels
7. Add more backgrounds (ai generated, nicer ones, set resolution)
8. Add final boss
9. Remove print statements from loops to improve performance
10. Add multipliers that are dropped from the top (extra slow, extra speed, nuclear bomb, immortality etc)
and add sound for picking up multipliers
11. Add bombs
12. Add bullet types
13. Change bullet and bomb types to sprites graphics
14. Add nuclear bomb
15. Add different type of aliens (faster, having guns, etc)
16. Add music per level
17. Add larger type bosses (we couldn't do that earlier because of rotation problem)
18. Add interlude levels that we use for talking to heroes as well (after meeting them on the battlefield) and that will join us for a 
short while
19. Add parallax levels that scroll from top to bottom r-type style
20. Add ingame thumbnail of upcoming bosses taunting player
21. Add aliens shouting at player (e.g. 'Jerk!')
22. Add levels with just story text to further the story
23. Add boss fights with massive onscreen enemies, not just ships
24. Find a smooth way of scaling (smoothscale is too blurry, scale is too pixalated) aliens
25. We should be loading high res images and then downscale and upscale, not resize but if we dont the code
crashes and moves straight to the next level. Possible fix is to downscale first before drawing the fleet, as the 
reason it moves on to the next level is because the fleet hits the player (as it's so big)
