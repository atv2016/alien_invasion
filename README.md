# Alien Invasion
Alien Invasion Redux

```Welcome Captain. You are authorized for destruction.```

Expansion of the original alien invasion by Eric Matthes from Python fame. I used this as a vehicle for learning about PyGame and Python in general so i might add things in here that have no need to be in there.
All the mistakes and things that don't work properly, or are hacky, are all mine. This is a work in progress and everything that still needs to be done is listed in the TODO list.

The game will ask you to register as a pilot. Type your name or press enter if you want to proceed as a anonymous flyer.

A Hud is kept in the bottom, with your picture, and ammunition in the right corner. Score is kept in the top left, and your healthbar is shown in the top right corner.

Before the final boss level starts a little heart to heart with the bad guy is shown on screen.
