# Alien Invasion
Alien Invasion Redux

```Welcome Captain. You are authorized for destruction.```

Expansion of the original alien invasion by Eric Matthes from Python fame. I used this as a vehicle for learning about PyGame and Python in general so i might add things in here that have no need to be in there.
All the mistakes and things that don't work properly, or are hacky, are all mine. This is a work in progress and everything that still needs to be done is listed in the TODO list.
