Expansion of the original alien invasion by Eric Matthes from Python fame. I used this as a vehicle for learning about PyGame and Python in general.
All the mistakes and things that don't work properly, or are hacky, are all mine. 

# Assets
All sounds are created by me.
I don't know where the backgrounds or alien assets come from so please use your own if you fork this and redistribute.

A camera<br>
